The purpose of this documentation is to clearly document the modified carbon framework calculator that now computes the electricity usage of an advertising campaign. At its core, this calculator leverages the same framework as the SRI Carbon Calculator however changes have been made to certain parameters and calculations to extrapulate the figures for electricity usage rather than carbon emissions. 

All computations and assumption will be made in the __main__.py file. 

To run simply activate your virtual environment and run the command 

python3 src/electricity
